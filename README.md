# Hey there! 👋 Welcome to my GitHub profile! 😄

## Who am I? 🤔

I'm a **Senior Platform Engineer** with so many years (a decade plus some years)😂 of experience designing and building **cloud-native applications**, **distributed systems**, and **resilient infrastructures** (just to name a few). 🌐💻

From architecting scalable systems using **AWS**, **Kubernetes**, and **Terraform** to developing high-performance backend applications with **Java** and **Go**, I’ve worn many hats along the way! 🎩💡

I'm a firm believer in **continuous improvement**, **automation**, and building systems that **scale like a pro**! I’m also passionate about **mentoring junior engineers** and making sure the team is not just productive but *enjoying the ride*. 🚀

## Some of the tools and technologies I love: 🔧

- **AWS** (Yes, I’m a cloud nerd ☁️)
- **Java** & **Go** (Backend magic 🧙‍♂️)
- **Kubernetes & Docker** (Containerizing everything like a boss 🚢)
- **Terraform** (Infrastructure as code, because I like my setups to be repeatable 🔁)
- **Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK Stack** (Monitoring everything, always 📊)
- **Jenkins & CI/CD pipelines** (Automating all the things 🚀)

## Fun Facts About Me 🤓

- I can talk about cloud architecture all day… and still have more to say. ☁️
- I mentor junior engineers, but let’s be real – they probably teach me as much as I teach them. 👨‍🏫
- I can probably debug your issues before you even finish your coffee. ☕💻
